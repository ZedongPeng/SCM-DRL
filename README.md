# SCM-DRL

This repository contains the implementation of the paper [Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Capacitated Supply Chain optimization under Demand Uncertainty](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8997498).

The implementation is based on the [DRL CS 294 homework](https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework/blob/master/hw2/train_pg_f18.py).
